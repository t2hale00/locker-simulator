## Parcel App Project


Welcome to the Parcel App project! This web application simulates an automated parcel delivery point/locker system, akin to popular services like Posti and Matkahuolto in Finland, wherein a user can send and pickup parcels using a locker delivery system. The system features three primary component applications: **the Consumer Application, the Delivery Driver Application, and the Locker Simulator**. In addition to these three prime features, a **Parcel Generator “Robot”** is also implemented to imitate parcel notification and retrieval.

## Project Description

The Parcel App project was conceived as part of the Advanced Web Applications Development course, aimed at enhancing the web application and development skills of the team members. The goal was to create an app where team members could showcase their skills in web development.

## Key Features

### 1. Consumer User Application

- **User-Friendly Signup & Authentication:** Easy signup and authentication with username and password.
- **Parcel History & Notifications:** View detailed parcel information, and history, and receive real-time notifications.
- **Account Flexibility:** Users can delete accounts while preserving parcel data.
- **Effortless Parcel Sending:** Send parcels with ease, selecting a delivery drop-off location and receiving a pickup code.

### 2. Parcel Locker Touchscreen Simulator

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simulate parcel pickup and delivery operations with a touchscreen interface.
- **Secure Code Validation:** Enter pickup and delivery codes with validation for seamless operations.

### 3. Delivery Driver Application

- **Parcel Management:** Drivers can view available cabinets, mark parcels as picked up, and deliver to parcel lockers.

### 4. Parcel Generator "Robot"
- **Parcel generator robot:** An application that generates new parcels for consumer users. 

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the most used technologies in web development. The backend utilizes Node.js, Express, and API for scalable and secure server-side logic. The frontend is built with JavaScript and React, offering a sleek and intuitive user interface. MySQL is used for the database, and Azure is utilized for database hosting and deployment.

## Project Team

Our dedicated team members collaborated to bring the Parcel App to life. Each team member played a crucial role in the project's success:

- **Lea Hampinen:** Frontend and Backend Development
- **Shujuan Xu:** Frontend and Backend Development
- **Yixin Gao:** Frontend and Backend Development

## Database Structure

Parcel App utilizes MySQL, a relational database with a well-defined structure. Key entities include the user table, cabinets table, locations table, and parcel table. The database design is optimized for efficient data retrieval and storage, and relationships are established to maintain data integrity.

## User Interface (UI) Description

Our user interface is crafted to be user-friendly and visually appealing. Users can easily navigate through the application, track parcels, and manage parcel shipments effortlessly. The Responsive UI ensures a user-friendly experience on various screen sizes.

## Installation and Usage

To get started with Parcel App, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repositories:**
   - [Consumer User Application](https://github.com/t2hale00/user-app): `git clone https://github.com/t2hale00/user-app.git`
   - [Delivery Driver Application](https://github.com/t2hale00/delivery-driver-app): `git clone https://github.com/t2hale00/delivery-driver-app.git`
   - [Locker Simulator](https://github.com/t2hale00/locker-simulator): `git clone https://github.com/t2hale00/locker-simulator.git`
   - [Parcel Generator “Robot”](https://github.com/t2hale00/parcel-generator-robot): `git clone https://github.com/t2hale00/parcel-generator-robot.git`

2. **Install dependencies in every repository:** `npm install`

3. **Configure the backend settings:** !! Remember to directly set/change the database credentials based on your local database.!!
         STEPS: Launch MySQL Workbench.
               Log in and connect to your MySQL database server.
               Go to "File" -> "Open SQL Script..."
               Choose your SQL file and click "Open."
               Click the lightning bolt icon or select "Query" -> "Execute."
               You can also use MySQL Client.

               Return to the backend and edit the user, password, and database name to connect to your local database.

4. **Run the applications:** `npm start`  !! RUN THE CONSUMER USER APPLICATION FIRST BEFORE THE OTHER APPS !!

5. **Access Parcel App through your preferred web browser.**
